# hello-world
My first git repository

New years resolution an hour of code a day. 
To manage all the versions of Hello World I will be writing, I will need a way to manage the versions!
So I must learn to tame the monster called GIT!


We are going to add about 1000 more versions of hello world.  We will find the most efficient(sp?) (I think cool is better) way to output Hello World!
